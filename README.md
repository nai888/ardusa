# Ardusa: A Grammar of the Ardusan Languages

## Current Build

You can find the most recently compiled working draft PDF [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nai888/ardusa@master/Ardusa.pdf).

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed grammatical description of the languages of Ardusa, a fictional landmass set in a fictional constructed world. This project serves as a method for linguistic research, as an intellectual exercise, and as an outlet for creative and artistic expression. It is intended primarily for my own personal use and entertainment, though others with similar linguistic interests will hopefully find it interesting and entertaining as well. I have chosen to use LaTeX to typeset this grammar because it provides a way to be clear, consistent, and organized. Further, since LaTeX uses plain text files, it allows me to use Git for version control so I can keep track of changes over time.

## Compiling

Clone the repository and compile `Ardusa.tex` using `xelatex`, `biber`, `makeindex`, and `makeglossaries`. The standard TeXLive installation should include all the necessary packages. Make sure to include the [Junicode](http://junicode.sourceforge.net/) and [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) fonts, which are used throughout the document.
