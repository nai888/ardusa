\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Given that I have not taken any official linguistics coursework, this work would not be possible without several sources of linguistic knowledge. Mark Rosenfelder's \textit{The Language Construction Kit} and \textit{Advanced Language Construction Kit} were important to my first starting out in the world of language construction, with further knowledge gained from David J.~Peterson's \textit{The Art of Language Invention}. Of course, I received an unmeasurable amount of education via several online sources, especially the articles available on Wikipedia. Yet more education, as well as inspiration and motivation, have come from the \textit{Conlangery} podcast and all its hosts and guests.

Finally, this document's format, layout, and organization have been influenced by a few sources, including:
