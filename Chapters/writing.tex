\chapter{Writing}

As seen throughout the examples of the previous chapter, \lang{} uses its own distinct writing system. This script (still under construction) grew out of the original runic alphabet, the Tandic Runes, natively known as \scr{ýndyymittáu} \fw{ýndyymittáu} \defn{magic script}.

The modern \lang{} script is a full alphabet.\autocite{wals-141}
