Given that I have not taken any official linguistics coursework, this work would not be possible without several sources of linguistic education. Mark Rosenfelder's \textit{The Language Construction Kit}\nocite{mrlck} and \textit{Advanced Language Construction Kit}\nocite{mralck} were important to my first starting out in the world of language construction, with further knowledge gained from David J.~Peterson's \textit{The Art of Language Invention}\nocite{djpali}. Of course, I received an unmeasurable amount of education via several online sources, especially the articles available on Wikipedia. Yet more education, as well as inspiration and motivation, have come from the \textit{Conlangery} podcast and all its hosts and guests. Lexicon generation received guidance from Mark Rosenfelder's \textit{The Conlanger's Lexipedia}\nocite{mrcl} and William S.~Annis' \textit{A Conlanger's Thesaurus}\nocite{wsact}.

Finally, this document's format, layout, and organization have been influenced by several sources, particularly Thomas E.~Payne's \textit{Describing Morphosyntax}\nocite{descms}, Carsten Becker's \textit{A Grammar of Ayeri}\nocite{ayeri}, and Matt Pearson's \textit{The Okuna Reference Grammar}\nocite{okuna}.
