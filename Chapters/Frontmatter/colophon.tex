\landn{} is a fictional landmass set in a fictional constructed world. All of the languages spoken on \landn{}, such as \langtvk, \langank, \langrdk, and others, are themselves fictional, spoken by fictional groups of people, and as such are not related to any naturally existing languages. These languages' vocabularies are entirely \fw{a priori}, which means that no words are derived from the vocabularies of real-world languages. That being said, these languages are intended to be naturalistic, so similarities will occur. Nonetheless, any actual duplication is accidental.\\[\baselineskip]
