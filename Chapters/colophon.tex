\lang{} is a fictional language spoken by a fictional group of people, and as such is not related to any naturally existing languages. \lang{}'s vocabulary is entirely \fw{a priori}, which means that no \lang{} words are derived from the vocabularies of real-world languages. That being said, \lang{} is intended to be naturalistic, so similarities will occur. Elements of \lang{}'s phonology and grammar were inspired by real-world languages, and it grew from previous language projects by \@author. Nonetheless, any actual duplication is accidental.\\[\baselineskip]
